üöß Work in progress..

## About the project

A job board platform where you can search for remote Software Engineer jobs and track job applications all in one place.  

üí° You‚Äôll get an overview of this app as described below, although there are more functionalities.
I‚Äôm working on more details.  

#### Search jobs

You get a list of jobs on a Job Search page. You can jump to the details and save jobs you‚Äôre interested in.  

![jobSearch1](https://github.com/yumietzk/remotely/assets/61277579/0deee84a-eadc-4f18-9b1c-02b53779cf9f)  

You can filter the list of jobs and search for jobs by position.

#### Tracking jobs

You can see the jobs that you save in the ‚ÄúNo Status‚Äù section on an Application Tracker page.

You can manage the applications on an Application Tracker page, categorizing them.

```sh
src
|
+-- assets           # assets folder containing all the static files
|
+-- components       # shared components used across the entire application
|
+-- contexts         # contexts folder
|
+-- data             # data folder
|
+-- features         # feature based modules
|
+-- hooks            # shared hooks used across the entire application
|
+-- pages            # route components for feature pages
|
+-- routes           # routes configuration
|
+-- services         # shared helper functions for api calling
